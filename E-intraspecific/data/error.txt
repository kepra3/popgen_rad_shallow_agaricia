COMMON ERRORS IN DATA FILES
- Be careful that the numbers of individuals and categories given (format numbers) are correct.
- Use a point, not a coma, for decimal separator when defining distances or spatial coordinates.
- Spatial coordinates must be given following an orthogonal system
	(degree of longitude / latitude will not be interpreted correctly, use an UTM system instead).
- Alleles must be identified by numbers, not letters.
- Empty columns are not allowed. 
	Missing alleles or genotypes must be specified by 0 (or 00 or 000 according to the number of digits per allele).
- If one allele of a genotype is undefined, put 0 (or 00, or 000) on the right side. 
	(if put on the left side the genotype would be interpreted as of a lower ploidy level.)
- The list of genotypes must be followed by a line with the word END.
- When defining spatial or genetic distances, be careful that the matrix size or the number of lines (column format) is correct.
- When defining pairwise spatial distances, be careful that individual or population names are correct (case matter!) and all are distinct.
	Note that population names vary according to the way populations are defined (check the manual).
- When defining pairwise spatial distances, be careful that they are given for the correct level of analysis (individuals or populations).
- When defining pairwise genetic distances between alleles, be careful that locus names are correct (case matter!).
- If you get the message "End of file unexpected on line ... from file ...", check the first line of pairwise spatial distances (M... or C...) or genetic distances (locus names)
- Statistics such as Nst or dm2 require a matrix with pairwise genetic distances between alleles.
	Do not select these statistics otherwise.
- Some worksheet or text editors might produce a file not readable by SPAGeDi according to the saving format,
	in which case the error message is: "WARNING: cannot read the first line containing the 6 format numbers..."
	'Tab delimited text' or 'DOS text' saving formats should work.
